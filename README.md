# Supalogger
Quickly filter your logs from any command.

## Usage
Info below assumes you have added an alias for the logger, otherwise, replace `logger` with `python -m logger`.

```bash
logger npm run somecommand
logger cat /var/log/syslog
```

## Documentation
The documentation is available within the logger itself, simply run `logger` and then hit `shift+h` to read the docs.

## Installation
Installation has not been productionised yet. Coming soon!
<!-- ```bash
pip install hlogger
``` -->

## Cross compatibility
### Linux
* Assumes that you have `xclip` installed and configured to implement copy behaviour. (maybe replace with a library?)

### Windows
* Copy behaviour not currently implemented.
